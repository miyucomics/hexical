      <meta property="og:description" content="Media is the energy of thought, so it stands to reason that I should be able to simply think magic into existence rather than waving around a staff. After all, I have two chunks&#39; worth of charged amethyst in me at my prime, double that of a staff&#39;s. Unfortunately, I am not yet great enough to shift arbitrary effects into reality. However, by etching a prepared hex into my mind, I can bring it forth into existence by waving my arms similarly to an evoker, taking media from my inventory." />
