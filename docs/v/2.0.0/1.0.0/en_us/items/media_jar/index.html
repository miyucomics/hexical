      <meta property="og:description" content="I can melt down all my Amethyst in this little jar! Unfortunately, the glass is too thick for me to draw media through it, although I have read tales that ancient Hexcasters were able to solve this issue and were able to bottle up liquid media in some kind of flask to use in their Hexes. However, this Media Jar also has some fascinating properties for recycling media." />
